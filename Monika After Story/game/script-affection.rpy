# For anyone wanting to write using the affection system the general thought process for Monika in each affection is as followed...
# Lovestruck - Monika is the happiest she could ever be and filled with a sense of euphoria because of it, completely enamoured and could die happy. She has no doubts the player loves her and that everything was worth it.
# Overjoyed - Exceptionally happy, the happiest she has ever been in her life to that point. Completely trusts the player and wants to make him/her as happy as she is.
# Happy - Glad that the relationship is working out and has high hopes and at this point has no doubts about whether or not it was worth it.
# Content - Happy with how it is, could be happier but not sad at all.
# Normal - Has mild doubts as to whether or not her sacrifices were worth it but trusts the player to treat her right. Isn't strongly happy or sad
# Sad - Is feeling down, not miserable or deep but certainly not her self-motivated self. Believes she'll get player. Has minor thoughts that player isn't faithful but doesn't take them seriously.
# Upset - Feeling emotionally hurt, starting to have doubts about whether or not the player loves her and whether or not she she was right regarding what she did in the game.
# Depressed - Convinced the player probably doesn't love her and that she may never escape to our reality.
# Heartbroken - Believes that not only does the player not love her but that s/he probably hates her too because of she did and is trying to punish her. Scared of being alone in her own reality, as well as for her future.
